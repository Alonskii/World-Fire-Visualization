# World-Fire-Visualization

This is a python script that shows the one day global fire map visualization and it is intended to show the pictoral representation of regions that experienced a lot and less of wildfire within a 24 hour period.

The file data was downloaded from https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data/. 

The output of the of the python script can not be uploaded because the file was too large, but there's a PNG file that actually shows the exact result when we run the python script. 

In the PNG file, it shows the areas that experienced a lot of wildfires, and also areas that experienced lesser wildfires across the globe within 24 hours.
